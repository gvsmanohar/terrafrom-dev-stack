#### 1. What is terraform?
- Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
- It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language.
- Terraform enables infrastructure automation by managing resources across various cloud providers, data centers, and third party services.

#### 2. Why choose terraform over other IaC solutions?
- **Declarative**: Terraform uses a declarative syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain infrastructure configurations.
- **Multi-cloud suppert**: It supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud, and other, allowing users to manage infrastructure across different environments seamlessly.
- **Integration with Version control**: Terraform integrates well with version control systems like Git, enabling infrastructure configurations to be versioned, audited, and managed collaboratively.
- **Resource Graph**
- **Immutable Infrastructure**
- **State Management**
- **Modularity and Reusability**
- **Community and Ecosystem**

#### 3. Advantages and Usage of Terraform
**Advantages**
- Scalability: Terraform scales easily to manage infrastructure of any size, from small projects to enterprise level deployments.
- Consistency: With terraform, infrastructure configurations are consistent across environments, reducing the risk of configuration drift.
- Automation: Terraform automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure, streamlining deployment workflows and reducing manual intervention.
- Collaboration: Terraform facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a centralized configuration management system and supporting version control integration.
- Flexibility: Terraform's modular design adn support for multiple cloud providers offer flexibility in designing and deploying infrastructure solutions tailored to specific requirements.

**Usage**
- Provisioning: Terraform is used to provision infrastructure resource such as virtual machines, networks, storage, databases and more, across cloud platforms and on-prem environments
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD): Terraform is integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure as part of the software delivery process.
- Infrastructure Orchestration: Terraform orchestrates the configuration and deployment of complex infrastructure setups, including multi-tier applications and microservices architectures.
- Compliance as Code: Terraform configurations can be used to enforce compliance standards and security policies, ensuring infrastructure resources adhere to organizational guidelines.
- Disaster Recovery: Terraform is utilized to define and automate disaster recovery processes, enabling quick and reliable recovery of infrastructure in the event of failures or outages.
